# UnityTcpClient
This Project for Unity(3D) TCP Client.

## Background
There are few projects in github which "correctly" work with TCP Unity3D.

I want use some library for my project, but many projects have lack of usage or very oldest of last commit.

So, I thought this is worthy to make library to Unity TCP Client who want to use simply like me.
## Goal
## Usage
